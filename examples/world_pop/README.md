In this pipeline, we do a small analysis of world populations using data from the World Bank.

The core analysis is done in `analyze_growth.xp` in which we find that % growth
from 1960 to today doesn't appear to be very driven by the original size of the
country.

Data was obtained on May 13, 2015 from here: http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL
