Welcome to flex's documentation!
================================

Flex is a command-line tool for building data science pipelines, particularly
in the research context. It draws its inspiration from make and linguini.

Flex seeks to address a fundamental issue that haunts every brand of
data science: over the course of a project, data becomes disconnected from the
processes that produced it. Once data loses its context, even the most basic
interpretive tasks become exceedingly difficult.  Moreover, attempts to
reproduce or rebuild data become fraught as the details involved are gone or
hard to reconstruct.

Flex makes it easy to create and update workflows (called pipelines) while
always retaining a connection to the data that the pipeline produced.
